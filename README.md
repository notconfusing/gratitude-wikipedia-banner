These files represent code used to create CentralNotice banners for the Gratitude Wikipedia project.
However because of how Wikipedia works, when they are deployed they are uploaded into the CentralNotice interfacesâ€”so the production versions aren't in Git.

## A convenient way to test:
* Go to banner.wmflabs.org (this was created by Max at CivilServant).
* You can create a banner at [http://banner.wmflabs.org/wiki/Special:CentralNoticeBanners/](http://banner.wmflabs.org/wiki/Special:CentralNoticeBanners/). 
* Click "preview on-wiki"
* Then the test file can be copy and pasted into the Browser's console.
